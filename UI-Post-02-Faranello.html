        <small>Examples</small>
      </h1><br>
      <p>In this post, I'll go over Scott Faranello's perspective on Dieter Rams' principles of "Good Design", accompanied by what I think
      are products that represent the principles in question.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle I: Innovative (Roccat Nyth)</h3>
            <p>What we see here is the Roccat Nyth, a top-notch gaming mouse. Before the Nyth, other brands like Razer and Mad Catz
            gave their best to have the most customizable mouse in the market (comfort-wise), with the appearance of the
            <a href="https://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-ouroboros">Ouroboros</a> and the
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mad-Catz-T-7-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B0095D1CM8">R.A.T. 7</a> (respectively). However, they didn't
            have performance and features as innovative and adaptive as their ergonomic shape.
            </p>
            <p>The release of the Nyth raised the bar in every aspect that makes a mouse a gaming mouse: supreme comfort, precision,
            versatility, durability, adaptability and performance. All of these aspects are somehow connected to the one-of-a-kind
            modularity that makes it unique. The Ouroboros, along many others, have removable pieces and that in some sort of way can be
            considered a module, but the Nyth went ahead with 3D printing support and complete rearrangement capabilities of its 12-button
            numpad on the left side. <br> <br>

            I'm not saying there's not, but I think that to this day since Nyth's release in 2015 there's no gaming mouse that has such
            a dense and high level of innovation. If there is one, the Nyth will remain forever as the pioneer.</p>

          <h3>Principle II: Useful (Shazam)</h3>
          <p>Over time, Shazam may have acquired various features such as connection with Spotify, playlist suggestions,
          charts and metrics about the most Shazam'd songs and a few tweaks here and there. However, Shazam is, and apparently will always be
          of use for its main task: naming songs for you. There are other products/services that represent this principle even better than Shazam,
          but in their essence, they're way more than just useful (such as iOS or Unity3D, for example).</p>

          <h3>Principle III: Minimalist (apple.com)</h3>
          <p>Year after year, release after release, product after product, Apple has shown countless times their
          care and virtue when making simplicity into a device or piece of software. Is no surpise that Apple's site
          to showcase their legacy is any different. The site doesn't get any simpler than clicking the product you want
          to know about in the navbar, scrolling to see the content, and clicking the little apple if you want to go to the home
          page of the site. </p>

          <h3>Principle IV: Understandable (Translate)</h3>
          <p>The tool that helps you understand what others say is quite understandable. Happy coincidence? Perhaps.
          Google Translate has more than 10 years being one of the most straight-forward tools there is for anyone to use.
          Type on the left side, you'll have it translated in the right side. Period. Translate is one of those sites that
          hardly changes over time, not because they can't or don't know how to, but because they don't need to do so (and I
          hardly doubt they'll need any time soon).</p>

          <h3>Principle V: Valuable (Google)</h3>
          <p>In my opinion, Google could be called a "meta-service", the service of services or anything of a similar nature.
          Anything that conveys its immense reach, and almost unaccountable value for nearly anyone. The amount of tools that
          Google offers is way beyond most companies have ever offered. Calendar, Keep, Drive, Gmail, Earth, ARCore, Daydream,
          Translate, Street View, YouTube, Google+, among many others. The incidence that any of these (or any possible combination
          of these) can have in aany of its users' productivity is immense.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle VI: Safe (Tesla cars "Autopilot")</h3>
          <p>The semi-autonomous capabilities of some Tesla cars can enhance driving more than meets the eye. Literally.
          Tesla Model S' sensors and cameras see, detect and make decisions on factors that are beyond a human's sight.
          This doesn't mean that the Autopilot can replace the driver (yet), but having real-time data of your environment
          that you couldn't see by yourself is a serious enhancement in itself, topped by the fact that someTeslas can
          take control in certain situations that you wouldn't be able to act as efficiently.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle VII: Long Lasting (GoPro Hero 5 )</h3>
          <p>GoPro is the literal side of the long lasting principle. Since its first incarnation, GoPro cameras are known
          for being virtually indestructible (indestructible if you're not intending to do so, most likely). This one specifically,
          (the Hero 5) was proven to withstand a 1000ft drop, in which the place it landed suffered more than the camera itself.
          Probably not in the same measure as physically, but GoPro cameras' design doesn't get old just yet (just smaller,
          with more resolution and more FPS).</p>

          <h3>Principle VIII: Aesthetically pleasing (OP-1)</h3>
          <p>Not exactly self-explanatory at first sight, but OP-1's minimalism and use of colors to indicate functions
          is just beyond your common synthesizer, or pretty much anything. From the selection of colors to the placement of
          the different keys, buttons and dials, the OP-1 does the exact opposite of hurting your eyes. Created by Teenage Engineering.</p>

          <h3>Principle IX: Unobtrusive (MacOS X desktop notifications)</h3>
          <p>In this screenshot from a Mac, we can notice there's something going on because of the two red arrows pointing at
          the FaceTime app and its desktop notification. This way of letting the user know of what's going on with your computer at a
          given time, takes place in every notification of similar priority, while occupying roughly a 5% of the screen, leaving the rest
          of your screen for whatever you were doing (unlike other renowned desktop OSs, that take most of your screen, interrupt and disrupt almost
          anything you were doing and don't go away until you interact with it, all while slowing your computer).</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle X: Honest (Useless Box)</h3>
          <p>One of the most self-explanatory and straight-forward products I've come across. It's basically what seems, and says:
          It's a box that serves no other purpose than not having purpose. Paradoxical? Ironical? Most likely, but the Useless Box speaks
          its name by doing essentially, nothing (just as expected).

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle XI: Thorough (Pocket Operator)</h3>
          <p>The amount of features and probable outcomes per square inch is insane. I think it's safe to assume that
          Teenage Enginnering has something with almost-ridiculously small synthesizers/samplers, portrayed in a particular
          way when we're looking at any Pocket Operator (they're also called POs).<br> <br> Often mistaken for a calculator (real life
          experience here) equally for its size, shape, and retro looks, the POs are sure the "living" image of thoroughness
          in products. The way it condenses such depth of its features so seamlessly and intuitively (it's not a bomb defusal kit, but not
          to be mistaken with ease of use, this is far from being a toy despite the fact of it being extremely fun to create music with)
          is a marvel of the presence of UX in physical products.</p>
