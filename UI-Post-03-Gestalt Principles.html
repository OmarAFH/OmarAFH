          <h3>Principle I: Proximity</h3>
          <p>The Proximity principle consists in indicating a relation among a group of elements based on a persistent pattern of distance between the given group of elements.</p>
          <p>In this example, we can see how YouTube implements this principle to differentiate the suggestions of one channel from another.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle II: Similarity</h3>
          <p>The principle of Similarity consists in implying relation among two or more elements by their color, size, shape, position, or a combinition of these.</p>
          <p>In this image we can see how Udemy has various sections clearly separated from one another thanks to their differences in size and color (the sections are the red-border zones)</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle III: Continuity</h3>
          <p>Instead of appealing to our cognitive tendency to organize objects into groups, the principle of Continuity is one of those principles that
          are related to our tendency to resolve ambiguity and/or complete gaps of information for us to perceive whole objects. Specifically, this principle states
          that our visual perception is biased to perceive continuous forms over disconnected segments.</p> <p>In this example, we can see how a rework of the Salesforce logo
          is in front of a cloud icon, splitting the latter into two lines. Despite this disruption of the cloud, our visual perception still manages to see a cloud
          and not two segments of curved lines.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle IV: Closure</h3>
          <p>Similar to the principle of Continuity, the principle of Closure states that our visual system attempts to close open figures in order to perceive them as whole
          objects rather than disconnected pieces. Our visual system can even perceive blank area as objects, due to its immensely solid bias to perceive whole shapes.</p>
          <p>In both examples (red-bordered zones in the image) the principle takes place very clearly. It is almost undeniable that those shapes are a thumbs-up and a square,
          rather than a line with many curves and series of dashes around the letter "A".</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle V: Symmetry</h3>
          <p>The principle of symmetry states that our visual system tends to analyze complex scenes in a way that reduces complexity. This means that we have the tendency
          to choose the least complex interpretation of our visual field in order to simplify it and give it symmetry.</p> <p>In this example, I've indicated the axis of
          symmetry (red line) in the Diamond Supply Co. logo, not only to show that both sides are identical, but to show as well how our visual system's reliance on symmetry is exploited
          to rerpesent three-dimensional objects.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle VI: Figure-Ground</h3>
          <p>The principle of Figure-Ground describes the way our visual system structures the data it receives, into Figure (or foreground) and Ground (background); Figure being
          the elements of a scene that are the focus of our attention, and the Ground being the rest of the scene.</p> <p>In the picure to the left, it's obvious that the Weather window
          is meant to have more protagonism than the mountains, and this is achieved by having it in front of the mountains' image. This would make the Weather window the Foreground, and
          the mountains the Background.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle VII: Common Fate</h3>
          <p>The Common Fate principle is the only one related to moving objects/elements. At the same time, Common Fate is related to the Proximity and Similarity principles because
          it also affects our perception of objects as grouped.This principle states that elements that move together are perceived as grouped or related.</p> <p>For example, in the
          series of dropdowns in the image (blue, dashed rectangle), we see how the first two are actioned and displaying all their corresponding elements. Thanks to the Common Fate principle, I think
          it's safe to infer that those dropdowns that aren't actioned, will display more content when they're actioned, even though there's no other hint than the reference of the first
          two dropdowns doing so.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <h3>Principle VIII: Combined</h3>
          <p>In real world visual environments, Gestalt principles work in conjunction with one another, rather than in isolation. The same way that this can be an advantage
          because there's more chances and alternatives to convey a meaning, this conjunction can be a disservice to this purpose, in view that unintended meanings can emerge.
          In this image, we can see how various Gestalt principles in the Red Bull logo are happening:</p> <p>- Symmetry. I indicated with a blue dashed line the axis of symmetry of the logo,
          where in each side of the axis a word and bull take place.</p> <p>- Figure-Ground: Behind the two red bulls (foreground) there's a yellow zone that serves of ground to the bulls (background),
          and at the same time, the yellow zone could be considered a Figure over the white space that is below the rest of the elements, serving as Ground.</p> <p>- Closure: Conventionally, capital
          letters "R" and "B" are completely closed, but the Red Bull logo doesn't fail to communicate that the capital letters of their logo are in fact an "R" and a "B" (If pushed a bit, it could be said that
          these letters are somehow symmetrical as there's one on each side of the axis of symmetry of the whole logo).</p>
